Course reference: [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-mysql-for-data-analytics-and-business-intelligence/)

Objectives: <br>
To fetch the data from the database (employees modified) and visualize the data using Tableau. 

Task 1: <br>
Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990. 

Task 2:<br>
Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

Task 3:<br>
Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.

Task 4:<br>
Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure. Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.
